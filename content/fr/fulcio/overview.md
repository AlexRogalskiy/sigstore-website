Fulcio is a free root certification authority for code signing certs, issuing certificates based on an Open ID Connect email address. Fulcio only signs short-lived certificates valid for under 20 minutes.

[callout] Fulcio is a work in progress! There’s working code, a running instance and a roadmap, but it’s not yet reliable or robust enough for public consumption. 

Fulcio is being developed as part of the sigstore project.
