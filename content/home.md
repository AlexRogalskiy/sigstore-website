    text: >-
      Not knowing where all your software comes from presents hard to spot risks
      to the integrity of your services.


      Most of today’s commercial programs, critical software and key infrastructure use open source software, linked together in a  supply chain - the map of relationships existing in a piece of software. It’s everything your software needs to work. The more complex and critical the software, the more relationships exist, and there might be hundreds of open source dependencies in just one project.


      But a high percentage of that code is insecure. Without foolproof ways to verify where all your software came from, open source dependencies open the door for breaches, supply chain attacks and exploits.

    header: The vision
    text: >-
      sigstore was started to improve supply chain technology for anyone using
      open source projects. For open source maintainers, by open source
      maintainers. It’s a direct response to today’s challenges, a work in
      progress towards a future where the integrity of what we build and use is
      up to standard.

    header: What makes sigstore different?
    imageAsset: ""
    text: The tooling focuses on signing and checking every component down the
      chain, and proving whether something’s really what it should be. It
      removes a lot of the effort for software developers to handle this
      themselves. And for anyone whose software depends on open source, it makes
      it easier to check for authenticity.

      text: We uses Cosign to generate the key pairs needed to sign and verify
        artifacts, automating as much as possible so there’s no risk of losing
        or leaking them.

      header: Transparent ledger technology
      text: A transparency log means anyone can find and verify signatures, and check
        whether someone’s changed the source code, the build platform or the
        artifact repository.

      text: Everyone involved believes in an open, transparent and accountable future
        for open source software. Everything we do comes from that shared
        vision.
