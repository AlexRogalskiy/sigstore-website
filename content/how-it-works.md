    header: How can you use it?
    text: We’ve combined a few technologies to create one single process. It’s a way
      for software developers to sign off on what they build, without needing to
      jump through hoops or know tricky security protocols. And it’s a way for
      anyone using those releases to verify the signatures against a
      tamper-proof log.
