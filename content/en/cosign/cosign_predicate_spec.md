`Cosign` supports working with [In-Toto Attestations](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) using the predicate model.
Several well-known predicates are supported natively, but `cosign` also supports a simple, generic, format for data that
doesn't fit well into other types.

The format for this is maintained within the `cosign` repo and available [here](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/COSIGN_PREDICATE_SPEC.md).
